Cube shadow (torch)

VS: 529EEA40.txt

It seems that the 6 faces of the cube are rendered into one single
texture and at variing positions. The texcoords are somehow preprocessed
in the vertex shader and/or CPU and than get sampled in the pixel shader.

Stereorization causes that same coords move to a different quad or 
even outside the valid texture areas. This causes problematic seams.

A working fix seems to need a detection of the bounds and a remapping 
to the correct area. How the quad selection works is unknown.
